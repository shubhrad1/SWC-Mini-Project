# SWC-Mini-Project
My mini project for SWC HTML-CSS-JavaScript Course

The main HTML page is named as <b>200102089.html</b> (which is my roll number).
The CSS page is named as <b>style.css</b>

I have used both HTML and CSS for developing the page.
There are a few minor variations in dimensions but the overall look is same as given.


Overall, it was a great learning experience!
